      <p>Advances in cloud and Internet technology such as chatgpt, which I have used to generate this text, have contributed to a notable rise in electronic trade in recent years, where customers conduct transactions and purchases online. This expansion harms an enterprise's resources by allowing unwanted access to sensitive user data. One well-known assault that deceives people into seeing dangerous content and obtaining their personal data is phishing. Most phishing webpages have the exact same appearance and feel as legitimate webpages, down to the universal resource location (URL) and website interface. There are several methods that have been proposed for identifying phishing websites, including blacklisting, heuristics, and more. However, the number of victims is growing exponentially as a result of ineffective security technologies. Phishing assaults are more common on the Internet because of its unregulated and anonymous structure. </p>
